# microsoft-rewards-bot
Are you fed up of searching multiple times everyday to meet your Microsoft rewards quota? This bot can do the computer and even mobile searches (through some tweaks) very easily in under 10 minutes. You can do whatever you want during the time.

Steps to install
1. Install nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install puppeteer in the directory you are using (npm install puppeteer)
3. Install prompt in the directory you are using (npm install prompt)
4. Download the file
5. Run node rewards.js in your terminal.
6. Put in the credential it asks (don't worry, this runs entirely on your computer)
7. Put in the speed (1 = 0.5 seconds per search), (2 = 1 second per search)
8. Watch the bot do all your hard work and enjoy :)
